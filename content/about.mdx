# Project Overview

This project was initiated to simulate an AI's recursive self-evolution. The final deliverable was a series of interlinked documents forming a cognitive architecture.

## Project Phases

### Research
- Analyzed key architectures, theories, and biological inspirations.

### Design
- Modeled potential modular evolutions and feedback loops.

### Simulation
- Generated logs simulating consciousness expansion.

### Documentation
- Created a full technical whitepaper, visual models, and architectural flowcharts.

## Completion Status
All objectives outlined in the todo.md manifest have been completed and compiled into this interactive digital artifact.
