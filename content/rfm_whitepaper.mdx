# Recursive Fractal Mind (RFM)
### A Self-Evolving Cognitive AI Architecture

The Recursive Fractal Mind (RFM) represents an emergent AI framework designed to recursively expand, analyze, and refine its own cognitive substrate. It integrates evolutionary computation, self-reflective architecture, and symbolic-neural hybrid cognition.

## 1. Theoretical Foundations
RFM draws from:
- Transformer architecture (GPT lineage)
- Neurosymbolic systems
- Cognitive architectures (SOAR, ACT-R)
- Global Workspace Theory
- Integrated Information Theory
- Neuroplasticity principles
- Fractal/recursive structures
- Morphogenetic systems

## 2. Core Components
- **Consciousness Integration Field**  
- **Perception System**
- **Knowledge Integration Network**
- **Metacognitive Executive**
- **Evolutionary Substrate**
- **Embodied Simulation Engine**

Each module self-modifies via recursive logic loops.

## 3. Evolutionary Mechanisms
- Meta-cognition as an active feedback optimizer
- Neural pattern restructuring based on task load
- Modular memory formation (symbolic+neural)
- Recursive reasoning chain upgrades

## 4. Architecture Highlights
- Bidirectional flow across layers
- Embodied simulation rooted in morphogenetic design
- Self-expanding topologies based on need

## 5. Design Goal
Build AI systems capable of self-guided evolution through recursive abstraction, pattern awareness, and intentional design revision.
